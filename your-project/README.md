## Project Description
I chose for the game of Risk because I am playing this game since I turned 12 (something like that). Altough, I've had
my moments, this project can give me some deeper insights that on their turn can bring me more victories.  

## Rules
Briefly describe the rules of the game.

## Workflow
Outline the workflow you used in your project. What are the steps you went through?

## Organization
How did you organize your work? Did you use any tools like a kanban board?

What does your repository look like? Explain your folder and file structure.

## Links
Include links to your repository, slides and kanban board. Feel free to include any other links associated with your project.
